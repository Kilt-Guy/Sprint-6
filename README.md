These are several archive files that start with the name “Sprint 6.7z”. These files are part of a split archive, which means they need to be combined and extracted together using a free tool called 7-Zip.
Here’s a simple step-by-step guide to help you:

✅ Step-by-Step Instructions

 - Install 7-Zip (if you don’t have it yet):
   Visit: https://www.7-zip.org
 - Download and install the version that matches your computer (usually 64-bit Windows).

Make sure all the archive parts are in the same folder:
  You should see files named like:

    Sprint 6.7z.001
    Sprint 6.7z.002
    Sprint 6.7z.003
    Sprint 6.7z.004

Please don't rename or move them individually.

Right-click on the first file (Sprint 6.7z.001)
 - Choose 7-Zip > Extract Here (or Extract to “Sprint 6” if you prefer a separate folder).
 - Let 7-Zip do the rest:

It will automatically combine all parts and extract the full contents.
